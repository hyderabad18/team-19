This is an android application that is used to Handle Events
for the "Youth for Seva" that can help the volunteers to get
the knowledge of the events that are ongoing or coming soon.

The admin may add events and notify the volunteers about the 
event along with the time constraints like start and end dates of
the event etc.

The volunteer may register for the event if he is interested
int that event. The admin assigns the volunteers to the specif-
ic locations. The remaining volunteers may be held in the waitlist
position. If any volunteer who is participating in the event decides 
to drop from the event, he/she may notify the admin so that the 
admin may assign other volunteer from the waitlist to that event.

If any event is successful, all the volunteers who volunteered for the 
event should get a notification that the event is successful.
